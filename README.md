# Linear Regression to Predict MPG

The most significant variables in our dataset which show a non-random effect on the MPG of the MechaCar are the Vechicle_length with a p-value of 2.60e-12 and the Ground Clearance with a p-value 5.21e-08. 

The slop of the linear model can not be considered to be zero, because the p-value of 5.35e-11 is lower than the siginificance level and the null hypothesis must be rejected.

The model does predict the mpg of the MechaCar prototype and Since the R-squared is 0.7149 indicates that the model is 71% accurate.
